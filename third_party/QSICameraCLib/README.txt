QSICameraCLib.dll

The library is built using the Visual Studio Toolset v140.

This library provides a more traditional API for which you need to include the files in the 'include' folder link against the .lib file in 'lib' and provide the dll file alongside your application or on the system PATH. 

Two simple example programs are included in the examples folder. Both are Visual studio 2017 projects. The C# examples requires .Net framework 4.8 to be installed.
